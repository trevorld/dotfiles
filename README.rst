utilities
==========

These are some simple shell scripts and configuration files that I have found useful.

To install and use (warning may overwrite some of your "dotfiles")::

    bash$ cd
    bash$ git clone https://github.com/trevorld/utilities.git
    bash$ cd utilities/config
    bash$ bash init_config.sh
